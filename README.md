# TODO React App

This is a basic React application for managing TODO items. 

## Features:

- **Create TODO:** Users can add new TODO items by typing into the input field and hitting enter or clicking the "Add" button.
  
- **Delete TODO:** Users can remove TODO items by clicking on the delete button associated with each item.

- **Local Storage:** TODO items are stored locally in the browser's storage, so they persist even if the user closes or refreshes the page.

```bash
cd TODO_REACT_APP
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Run the application:
